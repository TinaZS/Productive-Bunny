# ProductiBunny: Redefining Productivity, One Tab at a Time 🐰


## 🚀 Introduction

Enter **ProduciBunny**—a game-changing Chrome extension designed to transform your browser experience into a seamless productivity hub. With **ProduciBunny**, every new tab becomes an opportunity to enhance focus without the need to juggle multiple apps or tools.
